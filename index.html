        <p>let me say a couple things:</p>
        <p>
            this page is maintained by a <strong>professional</strong> bellend.
            <br>
            this part used to be about how i used flask to uphold the server,
            <br>
            but people don't like clicking on a raw ip adress for whatever reason,
            <br>
            so i moved it here to github
        </p>
        <div class="amazing">people who don't like my site can ✨eat shit and die✨</div>
        <br>
        <div class="interactable"><a href="links.html">extra links</a></div>
        <div class="footer">
